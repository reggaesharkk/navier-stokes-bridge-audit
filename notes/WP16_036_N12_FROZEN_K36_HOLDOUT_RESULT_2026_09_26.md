# WP16: N12 frozen K36 holdout — executed result

**Prince Upadhyay, Independent Research · 26 September 2026**

**Outcome:** all three prospectively specified N12 states pass the descriptive consistency gate. The coalition was frozen at [PR #73](https://github.com/reggaesharkk/navier-stokes-bridge-audit/pull/73), merge commit `8a9f603bb2048e5d712bb44b76835329a9dfeaad`, before the N12 continuation was generated. This note records the result after observation; it does not change the coalition or thresholds.

## Frozen design

The source coalition consists of the first 36 ordered source-orbit groups ranked by absolute contribution to the N11 target-only k-channel. The precise ordered keys, in their frozen order, are in [`frozen_K36_ordered_source_orbits.json`](../results/wp16_n12_holdout/frozen_K36_ordered_source_orbits.json). The original ranking input is archived in compressed form, with its uncompressed SHA-256 in the checksum file.

The preregistered descriptive gate requires, **at each** of N12 inherited, target-only, and full-final states:

1. the K36 signed contribution has the same sign as the complete k-channel;
2. K36 captures at least 0.90 of absolute grouped source mass;
3. K36 signed contribution divided by the full signed k-channel lies in `[0.80, 1.20]`.

## Executed N12 continuation

The deterministic `src/wp16_phase_cutoff_resume.py` was run from the saved N10/N11 continuation at amplitude `4.0`, anchor time `0.005`, seed `20260937`, and cutoff `12`, with search grid `40`, new global draws `16`, new block rounds `3`, full block rounds `4`, `72` trials per round, block size `40`, and initial step `0.30`. The N12 state had 3575 active conjugate pairs (2787 inherited, 788 new). The inherited quotient was 7.637638320072; the optimized grid-40 quotient was 8.695136695045. At fixed phases, the refined grid-96 quotient was **8.692984814467**. Refinement is evaluation of the same phase state, not another optimization. Runtime recorded in the raw row: 3614.314 seconds.

The N12 checkpoint matches the final N12 row exactly on its 3575 phases, search-grid best dictionary, and all 203 accepted-improvement records.

## Frozen holdout result

| State | Full k-channel | Frozen K36 | Abs. mass | Signed share | Sign | Gate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| inherited | 535.489718383997 | 543.201146297741 | 94.0485% | 1.014401 | same | PASS |
| target only | 535.488165390484 | 543.201146297741 | 94.0487% | 1.014404 | same | PASS |
| full final | 462.652056779141 | 477.397102581440 | 93.5198% | 1.031871 | same | PASS |

All 36 keys are present in each state. The pass flags and ratios were independently checked against the stored totals. The saved result was produced by the preregistered evaluator `src/wp16_036_N12_frozen_K36_holdout.py` at the frozen commit. These checks confirm record consistency and arithmetic; they are not a separate independent rerun of the 3D solver.

## Raw record and reproduction

All required raw files are in [`results/wp16_n12_holdout/`](../results/wp16_n12_holdout/), with SHA-256 hashes in [`SHA256SUMS.txt`](../results/wp16_n12_holdout/SHA256SUMS.txt). The ranking input is gzip-compressed to keep the repository compact. To rerun the exact evaluator, decompress it to `wp16_036_phase_velocity_rhs_sources.json`, then run:

```bash
python src/wp16_036_N12_frozen_K36_holdout.py \
  --current-json results/wp16_n12_holdout/wp16_phase_cutoff_escalation_N10_N11.json \
  --n12-json results/wp16_n12_holdout/wp16_phase_cutoff_escalation_N12.json \
  --source-json wp16_036_phase_velocity_rhs_sources.json \
  --output /tmp/wp16_036_N12_holdout_recomputed.json
```

Compare numeric fields with tolerance for platform floating-point differences; do not overwrite the frozen JSON. The original 50,783,348-byte source JSON has SHA-256 `193cbb7f485ab54ceed0d5cb38f97f0fc98c197e5f88e288fdbd277627608c8e`. The compressed archive is byte-preserving after decompression.

## Scope

This is **one prospectively evaluated finite-cutoff transfer** from N11 to N12 for a source set selected using N11. The descriptive thresholds were calibrated on N9–N11, so they are not universal constants. A pass does not imply all-cutoff persistence, a phase law, a cutoff-uniform analytic estimate, a continuum limit, global regularity, or blowup.
