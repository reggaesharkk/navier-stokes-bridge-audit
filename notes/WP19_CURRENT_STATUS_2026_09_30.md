## 1. Rigorous same-datum chain

The same frozen 112-pair rational datum has now been validated at four consecutive finite Galerkin cutoffs:

```
N = 11, 12, 13, 14.
```

Frozen witness SHA-256:

`4789e27170f28279b3c6878f8874547b303d5cbd4a20848f3d5d8088bd10a624`

Frozen K36 SHA-256:

`7da5fc6d39ee03140d42ba40c5158cc20b043de33e4cc7f3ea52b71b79143f47`

Common parameters:

- `nu = 0.1`
- `T = 0.003`
- no retuning of the datum between cutoffs.

The prospective N14 certificate used 120 whole-segment 128-bit Arb enclosures and returned:

- terminal L2 trajectory-error upper bound: `0.000012825905`
- `F(0) in [645.8037741471, 645.8037741472]`
- `F(0.003) in [-89.015834781, -85.160766265]`
- whole-path normalizer lower bound: `48850.68586052`
- result: **PASS**

The N14 workflow artifact contains 126 files. Its ZIP SHA-256 is:

`b0bb454fa320887c2b17dfd8a0bae916273253bb057ecff7acee3d6218234698`

## 2. Historical N14-N17 track is separate

The earlier WP16 phase-only / optimizer-derived continuation reached N17 and remains part of the research record.

That track is not the same experiment as the later same-rational-datum Arb family. The older N14-N17 states were optimizer-derived and were used for prospective mechanism/time-gate stress tests. They must not be relabeled as N14-N17 same-datum Arb certificates.

The historical N17 broad gate passed, while its separately frozen mechanism gate failed or became unevaluable. That negative result remains preserved.

## 3. Fixed endpoint support

WP19 v0.11 proves that every Fourier coefficient entering the frozen K36+C500 signed numerator and normalizer is contained in the N11 space.

Therefore, whenever the tracked normalizer is nonzero,

```
G_C500(a) = G_C500(P11 a)
```

for every outer cutoff `M >= 11`.

Thus the endpoint observable itself does not grow in dimension as the Galerkin cutoff increases.

## 4. Recursive closure variable

For

```
u_M = v_M + h_M,
v_M = P11 u_M,
h_M = (P_M-P11)u_M,
```

the exact low equation is

```
d v_M/dt + nu A v_M + P11 B(v_M,v_M) = Gamma_M
```

with

```
Gamma_M = -P11[
    B(v_M,h_M)
  + B(h_M,v_M)
  + B(h_M,h_M)
].
```

So all influence of the unresolved/high-frequency state on the fixed low state is mediated through `Gamma_M`.

A fixed-dimensional energy estimate gives

```
||v_M(t)-v_L(t)||_2
<= exp(C_strain,11 ||u_0||_2 t)
   integral_0^t ||Gamma_M-Gamma_L||_2 ds.
```

Hence a summable/Cauchy closure budget would transfer directly to the fixed low state and then to the frozen signed numerator.

## 5. Divergence-free output-frequency cancellation

WP19 v0.14 sharpens the closure estimate.

For `k=p+q` and a divergence-free advecting coefficient `a_p`,

```
a_p dot q = a_p dot (k-p) = a_p dot k.
```

Therefore a fixed low-output interaction pays the low output frequency `|k|`, not the potentially large high input frequency.

The resulting exact estimate is

```
||P_K B(a,b)||_2 <= C_K ||a||_2 ||b||_2,
C_K^2 = sum_{0<|k|<=K} |k|^2.
```

For `K=11`, independent Wolfram enumeration gives:

- 5,574 nonzero integer output modes;
- `sum |k|^2 = 404724`;
- `C_11 = sqrt(404724) ~= 636.179220031588`.

## 6. What is now proved about the continuum closure

For one fixed Leray-Hopf solution, the direct high-shell-to-low closure increments are absolutely summable.

The v0.14 estimate yields, for direct shell additions,

```
||Delta Gamma||_2
<= C_11 [2 ||w||_2 ||s||_2 + ||s||_2^2].
```

Together with the Leray-Hopf energy inequality, the direct tail inside one fixed solution tends to zero.

This establishes a well-defined fixed-low closure limit for a weak solution.

## 7. What remains open for all-cutoff transfer

For the **different** consecutive Galerkin solutions `u_M` and `u_{M+1}`, energy/dissipation control alone gives only a worst-case direct contribution with leading `O(1/M)` behavior.

That is not summable.

The exact consecutive-cutoff closure difference is decomposed into:

```
direct new-shell contribution
+
recursive state/backreaction drift.
```

The direct term needs stronger shell decay than the energy-only worst case, such as an integrated `M^{-1-epsilon}` bound, a Gevrey tail, or a suitable dissipation-wavenumber estimate.

The state-drift term remains the target of the fixed-P11 stability / dual-weighted residual machinery.

## 8. Regularity claim boundary

The project has also proved two useful no-go facts:

1. Negative K36/C500 values can occur on smooth finite Fourier states, so a negative static observable is not itself a singularity criterion.
2. Because the observable depends only on P11, it cannot by itself control arbitrarily high-frequency vorticity or a determining/dissipation wavenumber.

Therefore the viable regularity architecture is:

```
fixed low-mode recursive closure
+
independent high-frequency continuation/dissipation control.
```

## 9. Current next target

The current theorem target is to prove a summable bound on

```
||Gamma_{M+1}-Gamma_M||_{L1_t L2_x}
```

by combining:

- the v0.14 energy-level direct-shell estimate;
- stronger high-frequency shell decay;
- a rigorous dual-weighted or stability bound for recursive state drift;
- the existing negative signed-C500 numerator margin.

A successful result would be an all-cutoff transfer theorem for the fixed observable. It would still not, by itself, solve 3D Navier-Stokes regularity.

## Claim boundary

Current rigorous achievements are finite-Galerkin certificates, exact algebraic/Fourier inequalities, and a fixed-low weak-solution closure-passage framework.

No all-N persistence theorem, finite-time singularity theorem, arbitrary-data global-regularity theorem, or Millennium Prize solution is claimed.


## 10. Continuum a-posteriori scout

WP19 v0.15 now measures the full continuum truncation residual `Q14 B(u14,u14)` on the saved N14 predictor nodes.

The strongest immediate diagnostic is the norm separation:

- `L2_t H^-1 ~= 0.3312582611`;
- `L1_t H^-1 ~= 0.0166855303`;
- `L2_t L2 ~= 4.9703990588`;
- `L1_t H1 ~= 3.7718196582`.

Thus the node-sampled `L1_t H1` residual is about 226 times the `L1_t H^-1` residual.

This does not certify a continuum solution. It redirects the regularity-side work toward a negative-Sobolev a-posteriori criterion with rigorous whole-segment residual enclosures and an explicit `W^-1,3` bound.


## 11. v0.16 critical-space a-posteriori no-go

WP19 v0.16 specializes the sufficient strong-existence criterion of Brunk, Giesselmann and Tscherpel to the exact N14 cubic-Hermite reconstruction after the unit-torus Navier-Stokes rescaling.

Using 160-bit Arb arithmetic, one omitted mode `k=(12,5,6)`, and only the first Hermite segment, the gate proves:

- whole-segment omitted-mode coefficient lower: `11.93863890885675...`;
- corresponding unit-torus `W^-1,2` residual lower: `32.9162834523052...`;
- criterion quantity `A > 0.00720428952807...`;
- `log M > 9.326757996764e12`;
- `log(criterion LHS) > 6.217838664529e12 > 0`.

Therefore the published sufficient condition `LHS <= 1` is rigorously false for this particular N14 Hermite reconstruction and the stated published constants.

This is a no-go for one certification route only. It does not imply blowup, singularity, or nonexistence of a continuum strong solution.

The continuum-side next target is now a reconstruction-specific Fourier-linearized stability proof that retains mode-by-mode viscous damping instead of using a universal high-amplitude Gronwall factor.


## 12. Fast same-datum extension through N18

Floating same-datum predictors have now been generated prospectively for N15-N18 with no retuning.

Numerical endpoint values remain strongly negative:

- N15: `F ~= -86.92746`
- N16: `F ~= -86.70869`
- N17: `F ~= -86.47987`
- N18: `F ~= -86.42966`

The C500 surrogate is not monotone: its N17->N18 change is slightly negative. The magnitude of successive N14->N18 C500 corrections nevertheless shrinks sharply, with the last three observed absolute ratios near `0.178, 0.262, 0.261`.

The sampled fixed-low closure difference also decreases rapidly. Its L1_t L2_x total is approximately `0.01716, 0.00907, 0.00350, 0.000997` over N14->15 through N17->18.

These are scouting results only.

## 13. Parallel rigorous escalation

A generic same-datum whole-segment validator now runs N15, N16, N17 and N18 in parallel on GitHub Actions run `36669057015`.

Each job repeats the N14 proof architecture independently at its cutoff: 120 whole-segment 128-bit Arb residual/gradient enclosures, trajectory-error propagation, K36 endpoint sign gate, and whole-path normalizer guard.

Until those jobs finish successfully, the rigorous same-datum chain remains N11-N14.


## 14. v0.19 boundary-annulus correction: direct shell is summable

WP19 v0.19 corrects the remaining direct-shell conclusion from v0.14.

For a fixed low output `|k|<=11`, a newly opened shell `s_{M+1}` can couple to the old state only through the boundary annulus

`M-11 < |p| <= M`.

Thus the direct consecutive-cutoff closure term obeys

`||DeltaGamma_M^direct||_{L1L2} <= C11 ||u0||_2^2/(2nu) [1/(M(M-11))+1/M^2]`.

The series is absolutely summable because

`1/[M(M-11)] = (1/11)[1/(M-11)-1/M]`.

Therefore the direct new-shell term is no longer the all-cutoff obstruction. The remaining hard term is the recursive state/backreaction drift

`Gamma_M(P_M u_{M+1}) - Gamma_M(u_M)`.

## 15. v0.20 goal-oriented fixed-F11 adjoint scout

A reconstruction-specific adjoint scout now targets the fixed low observable

`F11(P11 u_M(T))`.

Observed endpoint values remain strongly negative from N14 through N18:

`-60.7795, -58.4633, -58.0254, -57.8962, -57.9152`.

The first-order dual-weighted shell corrections for N14->15 through N17->18 are approximately

`2.30313, 0.432965, 0.132338, -0.017294`.

Their magnitude ratios are about

`0.188, 0.306, 0.131`.

The linearized predictions reproduce the actual fixed-F11 cutoff changes with observed remainders of about 0.56%, 1.14%, 2.44%, and 8.95% respectively. The N18 sign reversal is captured.

This is floating scouting, not an interval adjoint certificate. It identifies the goal-oriented dual-weighted transfer—not a generic full-state norm—as the next rigorization target.
